                <p>
                 Unus is an agent for the House of M royal family. He was ordered to go to Australia with Exodus, Pyro, and Vanisher in order to try and take control of the country. While in Australia Unus was ordered by Exodus to scare a tribe of local natives. Unus followed his orders and when he arrived at the tribes village he was confronted by the Hulk, who then severely beat him for trying to hurt his people. Unus was then sent to an unnamed hospital where his injuries were treated.

                <p>
                  As Turbo, young journalist Mickey Musashi is the latest in a line of heroes who have worn her turbine-powered flying armor. The armor was invented by Yugoslavian scientist Eugene Stivak, who was working for his uncle, U.S. senator Eugene Stivak. The elder Stivak was secretly in league with hostile extraterrestrials known as the Dire Wraiths, who hoped that a combination of human and Wraith technology could produce battle armor capable of destroying the Wraiths' longtime foes, the Galadorian Spaceknights.

                <p>
                  Sunstreak was once a member of the mercenary organization known as Stockpile. Along with fellow mercenaries Joust (Boudica Gorman), Calico (Pania Panapa), and Unicorn (Aaidan Blomfield), she was hired by Morgan Stark as part of his scheme to acquire the Iron Man armors developed by his illustrious cousin, Tony Stark. Through a robotic construct known as Brass, Morgan Stark directed Stockpile to break into the old Stark International Research and Development complex on Long Island, New York. After an altercation with Iron man and War Machine, Sunstreak and her allies were defeated. Most recently she was released from prison to take part in the Fifty State Initiative and began training at Camp Hammond.

                  Constantly seeking media attention, Striker had the chance to prove he was deserving of it during an outing with Henry Pym and the rest of the recruits. Whirlwind ambushed the group but was quickly subdued, and Striker finally got himself on the news. Although he could have been seriously hurt, Striker wasn't surprised to learn his mother secretly set the entire confrontation up to kick-start his fame.

                  Failing at creating a robotic bride when Jocasta rejected him, the mad robot Ultron tried again. Ultron abducted Avengers member Mockingbird, his own creator Henry Pym, and Adamantium inventor Dr. Myron MacLain, hypnotizing Pym and MacLain into creating a robot bride using Mockingbird's brain patterns. Ultron named this robot Alkhema, nicknamed War Toy. Though Alkhema lacked Mockingbird's memories, she retained aspects of her personality, including a flippant sense of humor which greatly annoyed Ultron. The couple attacked California's Sun Lakes Weapon Center, a storehouse for nuclear, chemical, and biological weaponry. The Avengers defeated the pair by magnetically attaching them to a rocket and launching them into orbit.

Just after completed his military service, they met up in Frankfurt, and the wild Alyssa had a strong influence on the more conservative Richards. Challenged to rebuild a classic car, the duo quickly reassembled it and drove it in the London-Capetown Road Rally, a ten week race across two continents. They did not win, but the long dangerous journey brought the two of them closer together. Alyssa and Reed also visited the Himalayas, where they rescued child prince Bayan from the evil General Lao-Tse.

                    Professor Zaxton was asked by Don Blake to operate his new Android so that he could demonstrate how durable his invention was as Thor. Zaxton started the experiment once Thor arrived. It was quickly proven that Blake's new Android was virtually indestructible by taking blow after blow from the Asgardian. Suddenly the Android started to short circuit. With barely any time to spare Thor was able to throw the Android into the upper atmosphere where it exploded harmlessly.

Zhou’s possible ancestor, named similarly, had been the killer of the Iron Fist, Kwai Jun-Fan, but the Ch'i-Lin was denied the dragon's egg that day when the Lei Kung, the Thunderer stood against him. Zhou had an opportunity to hunt the famed Orson Randall, but Orson found a way to hide his chi from the beast, forcing it to go hungry once again. Now, the time had come for Danny Rand to face his destiny.

                Conrad Josten was the youngest brother from a large midwestern farming family. His older brother, Erik, ran away from the army to become a soldier-for-hire and, later, a super-villain. His crimes ruined his family as his infamy grew, but Conrad, fueled by pain and guilt, ran away from home.
                Not much has been revealed about the intervening years, but Conrad was later approached by Henry Peter Gyrich, head of the Commission on Superhuman Activities, who was looking to form an alternative hero team to the Thunderbolts, of which Erik had become a part of as the villain-turned-hero, Atlas.

                  Ororo Munroe was raised in Morocco, learning English from American films. Ororo's family was murdered under unknown circumstances, and she fled to America as an illegal immigrant. She stole cars in Harlem before relocating to Texas. Although Storm's mutant powers manifested during her youth, she was too frightened to experiment with them. In Texas, Ororo was mentored and befriended by slightly older car thief Yuriko "Yuri" Oyama. However, Yuri soon saw Ororo as a rival, and their friendship ended in a motorcycle chase which Ororo halted with a sudden rainstorm; Yuri lost control and had a seemingly fatal collision with a truck. Guilt-ridden, Ororo continued thieving in Texas, briefly serving time in juvenile detention. At one point she declined an offer to join Magneto's Brotherhood of Mutants.
